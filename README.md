React and API project.
You can list top 100 IMDb movies. You can list by category or you can just do a quick search. Once you click the image of the movie, you will see the information, image and a quick description about the selected movie. I've had the related API from rapidapi.com and used axios to reach the data. I styled it with Tailwind CSS. Have fun!



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
